<h3>Introduction</h3>

<h4>Welcome!</h4>
<p>Welcome to the Canvas site for the course Technology and Society for Programmers!</p>
<p>Digital competence is a key factor in ensuring the employability of candidates in all professions vital to<br>
  our society.</p>
<p>This course will provide an overview of how technology affects our lives as individuals, its impact on our social<br>
  structures, the way we work and how we in turn create, shape, or choose our technology. Social media, digital <br>
  governance, and artificial intelligence are all examples of how technology has profoundly changed our everyday <br>
  lives in the last few decades. An understanding of the benefits and limitations of technology is vital in any <br>
  profession, regardless of field or specialty.</p>
<p>In this course, you will acquire the basic knowledge required to harness the potential of technology and recognize<br>
  its limitations and potentially harmful consequences on work and society. You will learn to identify the <br>
  opportunities to use technology to foster inclusion and participation in an increasingly diverse and multicultural<br>
  society. You will practice communicating orally the concepts they acquire in a structured manner.</p>
<p>Some of the key outcomes of this course is that you gain the ability to:</p>
<li>evaluate and discuss technological and societal aspects of particular cases, or problems</li>
<li>describe and discuss ethical challenges at the intersection of technology and society.</li>
